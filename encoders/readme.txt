CS6913_Final_Project.pdf is the final report.

The encoders directory contains the project code and structure, though the datasets and fine-tuned models have been removed. The directory includes 8 Jupyter notebooks with outputs, serving as the core component of the project. These notebooks demonstrate how the datasets, bi-encoders, cross-encoders, fine-tuning processes, and evaluations were handled.

The Experiment Result - CS6913.csv file provides the metrics obtained from various combinations of bi-encoders and cross-encoders. These results were used to generate the plots.

The plot.ipynb notebook contains the code used to create the figures included in the report.
